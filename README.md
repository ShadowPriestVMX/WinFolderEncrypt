### WinFolderEncrypt ###


You can use it for "encrypt" your folders in Windows Operative System.

You just have to follow the instructions.

### You'll need to install WSL2 for Windows ###


----------------------------------------------------------

You have to execute it with Linux Virtualized in Windows.

*If u don't have WSL2 you can install it from cmd:


1- Install ubuntu from --> *Microsoft Store* <--(Free)

2- wsl --install -d ubuntu

3- wsl --list for check distributions.
  
4- wsl for run it.
 
5- apt install git clone
  
6- git clone https://github.com/ShadowVMX/WinFolderEncrypt

### Actually, this tool needs the folder in Desktop ###
 
 I'll update it for the next version for the whole system.
 You actually can use it in Desktop, remember that u can't move it after the "encrypt".
 
 Thanks.
