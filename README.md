  ### Actually, this tool needs Names without spaces ### [0.6.0]
  
  ### NewEncrypt ###
  
  With this new update, you can set the whole path of the folder. Even I can find it if you set the correct name.
  
  Made for different disks like C-D-E-F-G-H. 
  
  It's going to encrypt and disappear because it's gonna hide on 2ยบ plane.
  
  ### DON'T FORGET THE NAME OF YOUR FOLDER, IF NOT, YOUR ARE GOING TO LOSE IT. ###
  
  It means that you have to decrypt calling by it's name.
  
  Thanks.
